## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learnt how quite flexible it is designing the mobile view first. Using flex-direction to change layout of flex items and more about css custom properties.


### Continued development

I'd like to continue to work with Flexbox as I feel I'm not too comfortable with it just yet. I would also start creating the mobile design first before designing. I just started with JavaScript....super excited for my progress.
